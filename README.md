A take-1 at the scope of new exercises.  We'd make a few like this all similar in complexity, scope, and difficulty.  Some would have bugs, some with have lines to fill in.

There could also be exercises like this but with 1 logic and one set of routes that they have to build from scratch for the idea of practicing the whole project cycle
